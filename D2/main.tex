\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
% Begin Section

This section should provide an brief overview of the entire document.

\subsection{Purpose}
\label{sub:purpose}
% Begin SubSection
The purpose of this document is to outline the architectural framework of the Secure Chat Android Application, highlighting the principal design elements and architectural choices. Intended for a broad spectrum of internal stakeholders, including project managers, developers, domain experts, and team members, this document aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the system’s architecture. Familiarity with the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and a foundational technical knowledge will enhance comprehension of the details presented herein.

\subsection{System Description}
\label{sub:system_description}
% Begin SubSection
The Secure Chat Android Application is designed to facilitate encrypted communication among employees of an organization holding sensitive information and trade secrets. In light of increasing threats of corporate espionage, the application incorporates a Key Distribution Centre (KDC), mediated authentication protocols, and robust symmetric-key cryptography to ensure secure message exchange. Additionally, it maintains a secure log of chat histories, thereby meeting the organization's stringent security requirements. The system's architecture is crafted to support these functionalities efficiently, ensuring both security and usability.

\subsection{Overview}
\label{sub:overview}
% Begin SubSection
Following this introduction, Section 2 unveils the Analysis Class Diagram, providing insights into the application's structure through a detailed class hierarchy. Section 3 delves into the architectural design, discussing the rationale behind the chosen architecture, the interplay between subsystems, and the design considerations that underpin the application's development. Lastly, Section 4 presents Class Responsibility Collaboration (CRC) Cards, offering a deeper exploration of classes, their responsibilities, and interactions, thereby rounding off the comprehensive architectural overview of the Secure Chat Android Application.

\section{Analysis Class Diagram}
\label{sec:analysis_class_diagram}
% Begin Section
This section should provide an analysis class diagram for your application.

\section{Architectural Design}
\label{sec:architectural_design}
% Begin Section
This section should provide an overview of the overall architectural design of your application. Your overall architecture should show the division of the system into subsystems with high cohesion and low coupling.

\subsection{System Architecture}
\subsection{System Architecture}
\label{sub:system_architecture}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{itemize}
	\item SecureChat utilizes a layered architectural approach tailored for an Android-based application, promoting modularity and scalability in its design. This architecture divides the system into three distinct layers: Presentation, Business Logic, and Data Access, each responsible for different aspects of the application's functionality.
	
	\item The architecture used is the "Layered Architecture" pattern. This pattern is specifically chosen for its provision of a clear separation of concerns among the various components of the application, which facilitates ease of maintenance and the flexibility for future development.

	\item The rationale behind choosing this architecture centers on its ability to provide a secure, robust, and adaptable foundation for the application. The separation of concerns among different system parts aids in maintenance and future expansions. This delineation between user interface, processing logic, and data management components strikes a balance between user-friendliness and strict security requirements. Furthermore, the architecture's modular nature supports the gradual integration of new features and technologies, ensuring the application's long-term adaptability without requiring significant system overhauls.
	
	\item [structural architecture diagram and its description, detailing the relationships among the subsystems.]

	\item In developing SecureChat, we explored various architectural designs before settling on our final choice. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), known for its discrete services and reusability, was considered but deemed too complex for our straightforward requirements. Microservices architecture, offering high scalability and flexibility, was also considered but ultimately regarded as excessive for the integrated nature of SecureChat. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) was contemplated for its real-time responsiveness; however, its complexity in managing event queues and handlers led us to discard it. These alternatives were evaluated against our priorities of security, cohesion, and straightforward usability, guiding us towards a unified and less segmented approach to ensure SecureChat's security, performance, and maintainability.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Subsystems}
\label{sub:subsystems}
% Begin SubSection
 Provide a list of your subsystems, with a brief description of each. Be sure to document its purpose and relationship to other subsystems.

    The Account Manager subsystem is central to user management operations within the application. It handles tasks such as user authentication, creating new user accounts, and maintaining user data. It interfaces with the Accounts Database (DB), which stores user information securely. By managing user identities (UIDs) and related data, it serves as the backbone for user verification and is critical for maintaining user integrity and security within the application.

    The Chat Manager is responsible for managing the chat sessions. It enables users to view all their chats, add or remove participants, and also manages the encryption keys from the Key Distribution Center (KDC). By interfacing with the Chat Messages DB, it ensures that all chat data is accurately reflected in user sessions. This subsystem works closely with the Message Manager, providing the necessary keys for encryption and decryption of messages.

    Message Manager: Serving as the communication facilitator, the message manager is tasked with handling all aspects of message exchange. It stores, encrypts, and decrypts messages, ensuring they are securely sent to and from users within the chat. This subsystem interacts with Chat Manager subsystem to get the necessary encryption and decryption keys. This is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality of the messages. The Message Manager works in conjunction with the Chat Manager to ensure messages within a chat are properly secured and delivered to the intended recipients.
